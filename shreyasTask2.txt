Red Flag	                  Description
Fake sender domain	netfIix-payment.com — “I” is actually a capital “i”, not a lowercase “L”
Urgent language	        “Payment failed,” “account suspension,” “24 hours” induces panic
Fake payment link	Directs to a non-Netflix site to steal card details
Spoofed branding	Mimics Netflix email format but not from a trusted source
No personal details	Legit companies usually address you by name, not just “Dear Customer”
